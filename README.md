# Vehicle Anti-Collision and Pollution Control System

* Designed and developed Arduino based system which involves the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) that helps basically to reduce pollution and to avoid the occurrence of collision up to some extent.
* This system alerts the user to turn off the vehicle when pollution level reaches above the predefined level and displays the distance between vehicles, which involves different sensors to detect obstacle and measure pollution and LCD, LED to alert the user.
* Published research paper entitled “IoT Based Vehicle Anti-Collision and Pollution Control System” in IEEE Xplore Publication in ICECA-2019. [Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8822059)
* **Technology Used:** Internet of Things(IoT), Arduino UNO, Arduino IDE, C Programming language.
